Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
You can create a GitHub repository by following these simple steps:
(1) First, you will need to create a new account at www.github.com
(2) log into your account to access it
(3) click the "+New Repository" button at the right side of the main page
(4) make sure that the Owner is the correct account
(5) enter the name of your new repository under Repository Name
(6) enter a description of your repository if you wish, else you can skip it
(7) if you want to make the repository open to all github users, you can make it public by clicking the Public option bubble or you can make your repository accessible to only yourself by clicking the Private bubble.
(8) since this is your first repository, checkmark the Initilize this repository with a README, Add .gitignore to None and add a MIT LICENSE by using the drop down window and selecting said option.
(9) Click the Create repository button at the bottom

Now that you've created a repository, the page will refresh and it will display your new repository's page. Since the repository only lives on github (cyber space, the cloud, or whatever) you will need to make a copy (clone) of it on your [local] computer.  This way you can put the files you want to keep track of while you're working on it, and when you're done, you can send (push) it into your repository (repo).  To clone the repo onto your computer:

(1) Install Github on your computer if you haven't already
(2) Go back to the github repro page and click the Clone in Desktop button at the lower, right corner of the repro page
(3) a notification box will appear and ask you if it's cool if it opens another application to complete this
(4) click the Launch Appliction box in the notification box
(5) the github appliction will start up on your computer
(6) The github application will ask you to verify the name of the repository you want to copy and where you want the copy to be saved at
(7) when you're good to go, click the Clone button
(8) when the repo has been successfully created, you'll see the name of your repro listed under GITHUB on the left side of the GITHUB window of the application you've just installed 

Describe what open source means
Open source means that the all users has access to the code of the application.  They can modify it without repercussions from the manufacturer/coder.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think Open Source is a good thing!  It allows people to edit the program to their liking and it also allows people an opportunity to learn from looking at the code.  As long as the person/company writing the code gets the proper acknowledgement for their work, I have no problem with it.  I don't know if it makes me feel like utopia, but I believe that it's a step in the right direction and may bring about more equality to the world.  Countries that may not have the resources to make an appliction may have an opportunity to learn from it.

Assess the importance of using licenses
Licensing is uber important!  If someone has spent countless hours working on a project, I feel that they have every right to control what people can do with it.  Licensing spells out exactly what people can/cannot do with their work.  The author still owns the original copyright (and patent if it applies) and can withold/grant permissions, listed in a license, for others to use your work.  Without a license, people can do whatever they want with it (good/bad).

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Since I haven't used github often, my understanding about how to create and clone repos have been solidified by explaining it.  Reading the articles about licensing helped me realize how important that little document really is!

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Honestly, I didn't find the need to find other resources.
