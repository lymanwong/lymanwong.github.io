What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
I had some issues using the git appliction versus github.  I was moving files around and the git app had problems finding them afterwards. After using it a bit more, I feel a bit more comfortable with it.  I discovered that I had to either sync the git app or commit the changes.

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I don't think I had any issues as far as I recall.

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
The most difficult part, for me, was understanding how to merge.  I used:

http://gitref.org/

for most of the definitions.

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
Everything about git and github is new to me.  Therefor, I'd say everything about it!

How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I feel pretty comfortable with the basics, but the merging of different branches are a bit questionable.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
I enjoyed using git and github in general.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I didn't find it tedious since I'm still learning.
