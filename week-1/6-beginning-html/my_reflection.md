## 6. Beginning HTML Reflection

- What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't?
Most of the HTML tag has an opening and a closing, but there are some exceptions.  I think HTML is pretty straight forward, but I have problems with draing boxes and moving things around with CSS.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is pretty easy to put together, but it's also static and it's kinda boring.

- Did you have an "aha" moments where any concepts solidified? What were they?
Honestly, I did not have an aha moment for this particular assignment, but the DOCTYPE heading format was solidified as I used it more often.  This was pretty straight forward.

- Have you had experience before with HTML/CSS if so how much experience? If not how hard did you feel it was to learn?
I used basic HTML in one of my jobs, but we did not use CSS.  We had to create and format our help pages with it.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
