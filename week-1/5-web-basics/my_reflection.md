## 5. Web Basics Assignment and Reflection

##Part 1: Describe the following and give examples.

- Browser: Translates code from the internet and produces a visual representation for you.

- DNS: Domain Name System servers track the domain names and IP addresses of all the computers on the internet. When a user wants to go to a webpage as we see it in the address bar, the computer will ask the DNS server for the target's IP address.  Once the IP address is obtained by your computer, it tells the computer to go the appropriate page.

- Domain: A domain name is a representation of an IP address. There is a top level domain, which includes and everything after the period. For example, .edu, .com, .gov, etc.  The second-level domain comes before the top level domain. For example, yahoo or google. [google][.com]

- Internet: The internet is a system of interconnected computer networks that use a protocol to talk to one another.  It is used to communicate large amounts of information from one computer to another.

- IP address: An IP address is your computer's address on the internet.  It follows the format: 000.000.0.0 - each of the four numbers can go from 0 to 255. For example, 123.45.0.1 is an IP address.

- Web app: Web apps are dynamic and ever-changing.  Users can interact with them by either adding conent or gathering data for you. For example, www.Flickr.com.

- Web server: A web server is a computer or piece of software that can receive a request, gather the correct components, and sends the requester a web page.  Usually web servers live in farms with other servers in a warehouse or something similar.

- Website: Websites are static, simple page sites. They are built using HTML, CSS and perhaps JavaScript. No programming language nor a database is required.  We created a website in HTML.

- World wide web: The World wide web is an information-sharing application that allows people to interact with web pages through a web browser.  It sits on top of the Internet.

Explain how the internet displays your website after you push your changes.
1) You enter the domain of the site
2) The domain address is sent over to the internet to a dns server
3) The dns server obtains the ip address of the page and sends your request to the web server where your page lives
4) The web server sends packets of the page back over to the internet to your computer
5) Your browser translates the packets into the page you see.

## Part 2: Reflection
- What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
- How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
- Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
I learned that the web is a connection of computers and we are seeing pages from these computers through a web browser.

How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
It was pretty cool!

Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
I was worried when after adding my html document, it did not appear to go live.  I thought I did something wrong.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Actually I kept referring back to CodeAcademy for assistance.
