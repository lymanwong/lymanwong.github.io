<h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
<p>It's a technique of team prgramming which 2 programmers work togther at one workstasion. One programmer would be designated as a driver and another programmer would be a navigator. </p>
<p>2 programmers switch thier roles frequently. </p>

<h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h2>
<p>Based on Takkaki's experience, collaborating with another programmer builds a relationship and it is more efficient than working alone.  It also keeps the team focused on the project at hand.</p>

<h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Driver</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The person who writes the code</li>
        <li>Focusus how to execute the task</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Navigator</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The person who reviews the driver's code</li>
      <li>Makes broad stragetic decision</li>
      <li>Makes the driver concentrate on the task</li>
    </ol>
</ul>
