                    <p class="text-justify">
                    I'm a native San Franciscan and an experienced Product and Project Manager with a diverse background in tech and gaming industries. Over the years, I've worn many hats—product manager, project leader, community builder, and customer experience champion. I've worked with incredible teams across various industries, tackling everything from launching innovative products to streamlining workflows and building strong, collaborative cultures.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                    At Backbone, I boosted the Trustpilot rating by 109% in six months and identified trends that mitigated financial impact by driving strategic adjustments. My time at Scalable Press saw me driving a 30%+ increase in weekly revenue by expanding the product catalog and acting as the Interim Product Owner for Fuel Print on Demand. I also had the chance to spearhead the creation of gamified learning content at Hack Computer, further highlighting my love for games and commitment to engaging user experiences.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                    <b>What drives me?</b> Making a positive impact. Whether leading a team to improve customer satisfaction, creating scalable processes, or collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring ideas to life, I always aim to leave things better than I found them.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                    I thrive in fast-paced environments where adaptability and problem-solving are key. I'm passionate about helping teams grow, finding creative solutions to tough challenges, and ensuring customers feel heard and valued.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                    Outside work, I look for new ways to have fun, learn, grow, and make meaningful connections. You can often find me gaming (The First Descendent, Call of Duty MW3, or Pokémon Go), playing sports (softball or bowling), or staying fit.</p>
