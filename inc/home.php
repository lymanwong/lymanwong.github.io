                    <p>I'm a native San Franciscan and have a passion for web development, community management, gaming, sports and fitness.  Iâ€™m a life-long learner who's looking to join a team where I can integrate my past experiences to learn, grow, make great things, and have some fun along the way.</p>

                    <p>I started my career in tech in Customer Support answering phones and emails while paying my way through college.  During my time at Zynga, I've collected multiple awards in the Customer Support.</p>

                    <p>From there, I moved into Community Management at Zynga  collected a few more awards.  I've also dipped my hand into game design by making several successful in-game features while providing storyline and tuning for quest features.  It was an awesome experience to see the positive feedback the players were saying about my features.  I then discovered that I wanted to make epic things that people are going to enjoy.</p>


                    <p>After being laid off at Zynga, I noticed that making things people love is what I wanted to persue.  I started to learn how to code on my own and then enrolled into Dev Bootcamp.  I graduated January 2015 and here I am.</p>

                    <p>I want to keep learning and growing as an individual and as a developer.  There's so much to learn and experience out there that just thinking about it makes my head spin.</p>
                    <p>I know this sounds uber cheezy, but when I get to a point where I can help others, I want to give back. Ideally, I want to help anyone who wants to learn how to code.</p>
                    <p>One thing I remember from my days at Dev Bootcamp that really kept me grounded during those days when I'm stuck on a problem:</p>
                    <p></p>
