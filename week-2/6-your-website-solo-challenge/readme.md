## Summary

Regardless of whether design is interesting to you or not, web design matters to end users of the website and business management.  It's important to know about so you can work more effectively with other teams in the organization. This process should also help you learn to separate different parts of a site (design vs. content, html vs. css, user interface vs. user experience) and learn the process of developing websites.

In this challenge, you will making your [USERNAME].github.io site yours using the wireframe you made in the [6-wireframing](../6-wireframing) challenge. You'll also need to fill out the other pages of your site. 

You may not use Bootstrap or any other design framework for your site. 

Get creative. Have fun. But be conscious of time. This site will be a work in progress, so you should timebox how much time you want to spend on each part. You will be able to make improvements each week if you dedicate the time to it.

## Release 1: Wireframe to HTML

Reconsider your wireframe. Do you need to make any changes to it based on what you learned about design? Make those changes to the wireframe. 

While you're at it, you should also make a basic wireframe for the other pages on your site including, but not limited to pages for:
 - About me
 - Projects
 - blog-posts/index
 - Any other page your site needs

Using your wireframes as a reference, add content to your index.htmlin your [USERNAME].github.io site using HTML. 

You should include links to each social networking site. Use an image to tell your audience which site it is rather than text. 

Add the other information. Make sure to have a header, footer, and navigation bar. 

Once you have all of the content on your index, you are ready to create the other required pages. 

Make sure the links on your index will actually take you to the other pages on your site!

Don't forget to link to week 1's blog posts on your blog-posts index!


## Release 1: Apply CSS
Now you can truly begin to appreciate CSS, which stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets. Each page can have a similar look if you use the same classes to format them the same. 

- Add styling to your header, footer, and navigation bar. 
- Style and position the content to match your wireframe.

## Release 2: Publish your site

When you feel ready to publish your new, beautiful site, commit your changes! 

If you are using the command line, you'll need to add each file you changed to the stage, commit them, and push them to master. 

Remember, you can use Chrome Devtools to test out your style changes and figure out if you are selecting elements correctly.
