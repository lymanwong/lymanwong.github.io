				<p id="textarea"><b>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</b><br>
					One of the important reason why JavaScript(JS) is important in web developmen is because all browsers have JS interpreters built right into them! Currently, there are no other languages that have this advantage. You can use JS to edit HTML pages on the fly across older and current browsers! JS lets you create Web pages that people can interact with. You can use JS to tailor your web page to individuals based on specific characteristics, like screen size or browser type. Finally, JS integrates with web environment very well and it's one of the fastest interpreted language.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>What are the great things of JavaScript?</b><br>
					One reason is that JS is easier to learn than other languages. There are libraries of code out there that can help you out JS, like jQuery. You can use JS to create and modify objects.  It's flexible because you can also modify the language (syntax) to your needs.  There are also different ways to approach the same task.  JS is very powerful because it treats everything like an elment in a list and JS works by processing those elements.  Finally, almost every electronic device that we own can run JS!</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>What are the limitations of JavaScript?</b><br>
					There are a few reasons why JS is not so awesome. 
					To var or not to var: If you state a variable without using the var term, the variable will be considered a global variable. For example, if you use:<br>var ice_cream = "vanilla", the variable ice_cream is a local variable. Whereas if you use:<br>ice_cream = "orange", ice_cream will be a global variable. A global variable is quite different than a local variable.  The use of semicolon to seperate one line of code from the next.  There are also times when you shouldn't use a semicolon!  It's quite confusing in the beginning! Another example is that there are a lot of missing convenience methods. For example, there's no method to find out if a collection of items has a specific item.  Finally, there is no way for someone to work with files or perform other tasks that requires your system.

				<p id="textarea">There are many more pro's and con's for JS, but the only way you'll know if it's right for you is to try it yourself!</p>
