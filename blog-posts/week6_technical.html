				<p id="textarea"><b>What is a Class?</b></br>
					A class is a factory for objects (note the plural). If you don't want to create multiple instances of the class, there is no need for it to exist.  If you would like more information about classes, click <a href="http://lymanwong.github.io/blog-posts/week5_technical.html" target="_blank">here</a> and you'll be directed to last week's post.
