				<p id="textarea"><b>What is a Class?</b></br>
					A class is a factory for objects (note the plural).  If you don't want to create multiple instances of the class, there is no need for it to exist.  If you would like more information about classes, click <a href="http://lymanwong.github.io/blog-posts/week5_technical.html" target="_blank">here</a> and you'll be directed to last week's post.

				<p id="textarea"><b>What is a module?</b></br>
					A module is collection of methods and constants.  Modules are a way of grouping together some functions and variables and classes, somewhat like classes, but more like namespaces.  A namespace is a bully-free zone where your methods and constants can play together without having other methods and constants messing with them.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>How are Classes and Modules different?</b></br>
					A class can be instantiated whereas a module cannot be instantiated.</br>
					When you create an object instance from a class, this is the process called instantiation.  Like in my Stormtrooper example from last weeks post:</br></br>

					Stormtrooper.new</br></br>

					You'll get a new copy of class Stormtrooper.  You can't instantiate a module, and therefore it does not have <i>self</i>(that sounded kinda sad, huh?! lol).</br></br>

					The superclass of a class is a module whereas the superclass of a module is an object.  I know what you're thinking...foul!  What the heck is a superclass?!</br></br>

					Every class in Ruby has a superclass (except for BasicObject, which doesn't have a superclass):</br></br>

					For the context of this blog, I don't want to go further.  Just know that class's parent is module, but module is an instance of class.</br></br>

					Class consists of methods, constants, and variables whereas modules consists of methods, constants and classes.  The difference is that methods contain classes, which in turn, can contain variables.</br></br>

					Classes contain class methods and instance methods whereas modules contain module methods and instance methods.  Instance methods appear as methods in a class when the module is included, module methods do not. On the other hand, module methods may be called without creating an object, like Stormtrooper.fight, while instance methods may not.</br></br>

					Including a module into a class changes the method look up chain. So actually the class doesn't inherit any instance methods.  Extending a class with a module is same as extending any object. The class simply acquires the module's methods as instance methods.</br></br>

					You cannot include a class into another class.  Whereas modules can be included in classes and modules by using the include command.  You will include all instance methods as instance methods in the class/module.</br></br>

					You cannot extend a class with the extend method; only with inheritance.  In a module, you can extend instance by using the extend command.  It extends a given instance with singleton methods from the module.</br></br>
