				A rant about a few sites - 8.10.2014
			</h3>
				<p id="textarea">The two sports site I visit the most is the <a href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=sf">San Francisco Giants</a> homepage and <a href="http://espn.go.com/">Espn</a>. Although Espn has more topics to cover, I really like how they made their site seem less cluttered. While the Giants only need to cover their own team, the site looks busy and almost cofusing since their imbedded video starts to play at the same time while their large pictures scroll through their progression. Espn uses smaller pictures, which will allow the user to maintain their focus on whatever they like. Finally, I HATE the fact that the Giants page uses ads that automatically play. Not only does it startle me every...single...time, but it's also quite annoying!</p>
				
				<p id="textarea">I visit <a href="http://www.woot.com">woot</a> and <a href="https://meh.com">meh</a> for some of my shopping needs. Although meh spun off of woot, the site has quite a different look and feel to it. Woot offers more items for the consumer, but they are starting to clutter their page. For instance, they have 11 different categories you can shop for. For every page, there can be another 13 (or so) sub categories. That's a lot of stuff! I don't want to be scrolling up and down to look at what they got! By the way, ads suck! Now as far as meh is concerned, they only have 2 ads on their page and a single that you can buy from them. Nice and sweet. The site's overall design however, could use some work. Today, for example, the site used blurry images and the background box doesn't fit the text. When I look at the page, it seems like it was just thrown together (which is what I initially assumed it was anyways). Meh does do a pretty good job keeping the site look uncluttered and neiter uses ads that automatically starts. I'd like a site probably somewhere in the middle where there's a lot less clutter, but with a design that is bright and inviting.</p>
				<p id="textarea">Finally, I bought my fair amount of bodybuilding supplements over the years and I like to go to <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com">bodybuilding.com</a> over <a href="http://www.gnc.com">Gnc</a>. BB large rotating ad at the center of the page is quite annoying since the ad's rotation frequency is quite high, but overall I like how they laid out the page. They have tabs at the top and then you will see the sub categories right below it. The sub tabs are linedup horizontally so it does not block the ads. Gnc however, has vertical tabs that block the page.  On the left side of BB's page, they have a dropdown list that allows the user to quickly sort through their products by category, goal, brand or ingredient. Gnc only has the dropdown from the nav bar. Another thing is that BB integrates your personal profile into their online store. You can see a summary of your profle with access to your messages, requests, notifications, and more. GNC only offers a retail experience.</p>
				<p id="textarea">There are a lot more pros and cons for each site; other than the ones I've listed above. "Of course, you don't have to take *my* word for it." <--- Bonus points, name that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Rainbow">show</a>!</p>
