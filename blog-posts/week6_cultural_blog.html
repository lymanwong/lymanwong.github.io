				<p id="textarea"><b>What is stereotype threat?</b></br>
					Stereotype threat refers to the risk of confirming negative stereotypes about an individual's racial, ethnic, gender, or cultural group.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>When have I felt sterotype threat?</b></br>
					When I was applying for a school, I had to take an entrance exam over Skype.  I did relatively well, but the instructor felt that I was almost there.  He let me take another exam the following week.  Unfortunately, I had to take the exam at their location.  When I got there, I saw all these students working hard and I instantly felt overwhelmend and that I didn't belong there.</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>When has it affected my achievement?</b></br>
					Although I tried to push these insecurities aside, I was extremely stressed and began to sweat.  When it was my turn to take the exam, I forgot everything I knew and began a spiral of sweating and hyperventiliating.  Needless to say, I failed the exam miserably and walked out defeated.  Of course, if someone were to ask me questions related to the exam, I could have easily answered it.  Suckage!</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>What questions did I ask myself?</b></br>
					During this whole thing, I asked myself:</br> 
					"Who am I to walk into this place?  You know nothing John Snow!"</br>
					"You don't have a background in this, do you think you can get in?"</br>
					"Do you think you could really succeed?"</br>
					"Do you think you can be as good as the other Asian students?"</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>Are there other groups that may feel it?</b></br>
					Since I do not have a technical background, there are many groups that can feel the same way.  Although I'm not great at math, even other Asians can feel pressure to live up to academic standars that other races have placed on us.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>How can we help others in the same situation?</b></br>
					I think what DBC did at the beginning of the course did a lot for me.  The school went out of their way to show us that although we had difference backgrounds and amount of knowledge, we are all in this journey together.  Not one individual is better than the other.  They established that there will be times when you will be ahead and there will be other times when you will be behind.  Creating a safe environment where we can freely ask questions and say "I don't know" is a great place to start.</p>
