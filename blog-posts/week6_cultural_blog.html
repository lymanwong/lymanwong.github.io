				<p id="textarea"><b>What is sterotype threat?</b></br>
					Stereotype threat refers to the risk of confirming negative stereotypes about an individual's racial, ethnic, gender, or cultural group.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>When have I felt sterotype threat?</b></br>
					When I was applying for a school, I had to take an entrance exam over Skype.  I did relatively well, but the instructor felt that I was almost there.  He let me take another exam the following week.  Unfortunately, I had to take the exam at their location.  When I got there, I saw all these students working hard and I instantly felt overwhelmend and that I didn't belong there.</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>When has it affected my achievement?</b></br>
					Although I tried to push these insecurities aside, I was extremely stressed and began to sweat.  When it was my turn to take the exam, I forgot everything I knew and began a spiral of sweating and hyperventiliating.  Needless to say, I failed that exam and walked out defeated.  Of course, if someone were to ask me questions related to the exam, I could have easily answered it.  Suckage!</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>What questions did I ask myself?</b></br>
					During this whole thing, I asked myself:</br> 
					"Who am I to walk into this place?  You know nothing John Snow!"</br>
					"You don't have a background in this, do you think you can get in?"</br>
					"Do you think you could really succeed?"</br>
					"Do you think you can be as good as the other Asian students?"</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>Are there other groups that may feel it?</b></br>
					text</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>What can I do to help others in that situation?</b></br>
