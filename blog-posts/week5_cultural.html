				<p id="textarea"><b>One emotion that arose during my pairing session</b></br>
					While I am working with a partner on a pair session, I run through a gambit of emotions.  The emotion that stands out above all others is excitement.  I'm excited to work with someone new on a project.  I like to learn more about them and find a way that we can work best.  I also like to find out what's their thought process about a particular problem and compare what I had in mind.</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>What is kind, actionable, and specific feedback?</b></br>
					What is a kind feedback?</br>
					Kind feedback is honest feedback.</br></br>

					What is actionable feedback?</br>
					An actionable feedback would suggest a future course of action.</br></br>

					What is specific feedback?</br>
					Give specific examples of the behavior in question. It may have made a strong impression on you, but the person receiving feedback may not have noticed anything unusual. However, don't let examples distract from your core point--people sometimes respond to examples by giving excuses for that specific instance. You can say, "This is one example that shows the behavior I mentioned, but I've noticed it other times."
				</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>My feeling of vulnerablity when pairing and reading feedback</b></br>
					While working in a pair session, there is a sense of vulnerability that creeps into you psyche.  Sometimes I wonder if I know enough to effectively contribute to the project.  In the back of my mind, the DBC has done a great job at putting everyone on the same page and establishing that we should check our ego at the door.  In the back of my mind, I know we are all here to learn and there are students that will come in with more knowledge; others less.  I know that I will not know everything and when I don't know, I am comfortable saying so.  But I'm not afraid to do the research to find out the answer.  I also know what type of learning and thinking style I'm most effective at and I let my partner know.  So at the end of my pairing sessions, I'm happy to hear where I need to improve from a third person's perspective.  With that knowledge, I can work towards improving the "holes in my game".</br></br>

					When reading feedback, there is the same kind of vulnerability I've expressed above.  Sometimes, getting feedback from a live person can be a bit "sugar-coated" because no one wants to hurt another person's feelings.  In written feedback, people don't hold back.  Regardless, I approach all of the feedback the same.  In football terms, I can use tape (code) to evaluate my performance, but having a scouting report AND the tape is even better.  Still, the waiting game for feedback is a bit unnerving.  I mean, who likes to wait right?!
