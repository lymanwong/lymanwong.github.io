				<p id="textarea">One of the major problems facing the tech industry is employee burnout and work-life balance.  I mean, I understand that getting your product out provides companies with a competitive advantage and stretches out potential revenue, but at what cost?</p>
				
				<p id="textarea">I use to work for a company that required me to work 7 days a week.  During the weekdays, I would work 12-14 hours and during the weekend, I would work 4-6 hours.  Although I worked hourly, I would have loved to just spend some down time and relax.  The main problem was planning.  The product managers did not plan far enough ahead in order to get the work started.  First they would need to write a single page spec document and have it approved by their manager.  Then they would have scope meetings to talk about the feature with the developers.  Then the product managers would then need to write a full spec document and have more meetings to discuss the feature flow, resources, and get final approval.  Once the feature and art has been completed, the feature reaches QA to test.  With their approval, the final product reaches prodcution.  If not, the developers would go back and fix their code.  Since I worked in support,  features doesn't get released until the evening or weekend.  This forces me to get home as soon as possible and then login right away and report on the progress of the release.  If there are no p0 or p1 bugs, then we can relax a few hours post release and I can run my reports.  If there are serious bugs, then I would be on for hours until a hotfix is released and I have to wait a few more hours to see if it worked.  So it's easy to get into this spiral where we are always releasing late and hotfixing.  Once the fix has reached production, I had to make sure it worked and create a post-mortum report.  Everyone in the studio was working harder and harder.  Late nights were the norm and we were constantly looking at our phones for alerts.  As you can tell, it was hard to obtain a work-life balance.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>Is there a solution?</b></br>
					To the defence of my former employer, they did the best they could to provide a fun environment.  They provided video games, free meals, gym membership, massages, free drink, and many other ammenities.  I really enjoyed working there, but many of the employees there did not have a work-life balance and were working in "the red" more often than not.  The studio managment started with providing a weekly survey that everyone had to fill out.  This survey was anonamous and was used as a temperature check.  We would indicate how we felt about our workload and stress level.  From there, management would adjust accordingly.  The leadership also started work on approved features earlier and made realistic timelines in order to mitigate employee burnout.  Product managers were held accountable for not providing spec docs in a timely fashion.  Features were getting finished earlier so QA doesn't have to stay past normal office hours in order to completely test a feature.  The studio stopped end-of-the-day, late night, and weekend releases unless absolutely necessary (low revenue).  This helped the entire studio relax a bit and not play "catch-up" every day.  It also helped flatten out revenue spikes (due to feature releases) and provided a more linear and predictable revenue projection.</p>
