			</h2>
			<p id="textarea"><b>What do I need to know...</b></br>
				Asking the right question is a good skill to have.  I'm pretty wordy when it comes to writing.  You guys are proabaly sarcastically saying "NO WAY!" after reading a few of my blogs.  Part of my learning style says that I don't like to do tasks over again so there.  Ha!  Anyways, going through some of the required readings, I found a few hints pretty helpful:</br></br>
				
				<b>Imagine you're trying to answer the question</b></br>
				Imagine that you were approached with your question.  The first thing you want to ask yourself the following questions: "Does this make any sense?", "Is it clear what I'm being asked?", "Can I understand the question?", "Do I need to ask any questions in order to provide an answer?".  Once your question can pass the test, then your question is pretty darn good.</br></br>


				<b>Write a title that summarizes the specific problem</b></br>
					My titles are usually very lengthy and I get bored reading them myself, so trying to write the title last.  You can pretend that you have to be uber specific and effectively summarize your problem.  A good example: Why does str == "value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"?</br></br>
				
				<b>What's the context?</b></br>
				Before asking your question, make sure everyone is on the same train of thought.  Let them know what platform you're using and include all relevant tags in the question such as lannguage version, platform version, operating system,	any other relevant software, and any other constraints.</br></br>

				<b>Introduce the problem before you post any code</b></br>
				Try to keep it short and sweet.  Try not to include too many questions because <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zGxwbhkDjZM" target="_blank">"ain't nobody got time for that"</a>.  Rather, provide a super slim summary of the issue that includes how you ran into the problem and what you've tried to fix it.  Since you're trying to catch the reader's attention, try to make it fun to read.</br></br>
				
				<b>Help others reproduce the problem</b></br>
				
				<b>Include all relevant tags</b></br>
				
				<b>Proof-read before posting</b></br>
				
				<b>Post the question and respond to feedback</b></br>
				
				<b>Look for help asking for help</b></br>

			<p id="textarea">Question analysis: Do you still want to be in the circle of trust?!</br>
				Well, you can use (=~).  =~ is used as a basic patter-matching tool.  The only catch is that you have to use a regular expression (left) and the other is a string to match against.  For example:</br></br>
