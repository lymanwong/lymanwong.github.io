				<p id="textarea"><b>Exploring one of my values</b></br>
					For me, excellence really stands out in my mind.  This idea of excellence expands throughout my life; personal and professional.  As far as personal, I want to be the best husband, friend, son, brother, cousin, etc. that I can be.  Professionally, I want to be constantly improving each day.  There is always something out there to learn to be a better student, employee, and co-worker.   Basically, I want to be the best version of me I can be each day.</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>What was the last topic someone asked for my advice on?</b></br>
					The last time I was asked for advice was whether or not we should increase the fee for our fantasy football league.  Since the season has started, I stated that it would be unfair for those who couldn't afford the rate increase and we should postpone the hike for the following season.  The league agreed with my suggestion.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>Values and stereotype threat</b></br>
					Thinking about my values, I feel pretty good about it.  My values definately helps me mediate sterotype threat.  Anytime I feel down, I think about my wife and how lucky I am because she's so awesome.  Anyone that knows her would agree with me.</p>
