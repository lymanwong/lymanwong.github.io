				<p id="textarea"><b>My last big emotional conflict...</b></br>
					The Compass of Shame, coined by Dr. L. Nathanson, lists the four different defensive directions that we can act towards others when we're shamed.  They are Withdrawl (e.g. isolating oneself or running and hiding), Attack Self (e.g. self put-down or masochism), Avoidance (e.g. denial, abusing drugs/alcohol, or distraction through thrill-seeking), and Attack Other (e.g. "Turning the tables", blaming the victim, or lashing out verbally/physically).  You can read more about it <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

					When I was in grade school, I had conflict with someone in the grade above me.  I can't recall if there was anything specific we had conflict about.  Rather, I believe that he found pleasure getting me upset.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea">
					During recess, he would constantly tease me.  Since I had a short temper, I would immediately become upset and shout obsenities back at him.  He just laughed.</br></br>

					Looking back at it, reacting in such a way doesn't make the situation any better.  Come to think about it, he probably liked aggravating me.  If I could go back, I would just ignore him.  From that experience, I learned that I needed to be more patient with idiots.  :P</p>
