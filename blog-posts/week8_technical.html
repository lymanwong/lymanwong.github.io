				<p id="textarea"><b>What a regular expression and a regular expression literal??</b></br>
					A regular expression (regexp) are patters which describe the contents of a string.  They help you match/find other strings (or sets of strings) or give you parts that match your search terms.</br></br>
					
					A regular expression literal is a pattern between slashes (/../), between arbitrary delimiters followed by %r{..}, or by using Regexp::new.  For example:</br></br>
					
					Here 'nose' does not contain 'booger'(or does it?)</br>
					/booger/.match('nose') #=> nil</br>
					Did I trick you into looking at the mirror?!</br></br>
					
					Here 'toenail' contains 'toe',</br>
					/toe/.match('toenail') #=> #MatchData "toe"</br>
					so winner winner chicken dinner!</p>

				<p id="textarea">You're probably saying, "What if I want to know where it's at, bro?"</br>Well, you can use (=~).  =~ is used as a basic patter-matching tool.  The only catch is that you have to use a regular expression (left) and the other is a string to match against.  For example:</br></br>

				Since I'm from Cali, let's use the word like...</br>
				/like/ =~ 'hellahellahellahellalikeawesome'  #=> 15</br>
				It will return where, like, like starts.</br></br>

				On the flipside,...</br>
				/wave/ =~ 'Giantsgame' #=> nil</br>
				because we <b>don't</b> do the wave at Giants games!  I'm just doing my part to educate future Giants fans out there.  #publicserviceannouncement</p>
				
				<p id="textarea">What happens if you got special characters (aka. Metacharacters) in my search terms?  Well, metacharacters are (,).[,],{,},.,?,+,*.  They have a</br></br>

				but if you want to find them, you'll have to include backslashes (\\). It's like a dog marking it's territory for other dogs.  You're marking the special characters for the computer to do somthing else.  For example:</br></br>

				/1 \+2 = 3\?/.match('Does 1 + 2 = 3?') #=> #MatchData "1 + 2 = 3?"</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>What if I got a few things I want to check for?</b></br>
				You are full of questions, aren't you?!  Let me drop some knowledge:  In this case, you would use a character class.  You'll still use .match but you'll have to do something different in the syntax:</br></br>
				
				If you're on the final stage of Wheel of Fortune and the category is film.  You can select a bunch of letters like this:</br></br>

				/S[aeiou]percalifragilisticexpialidocious/.match("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious")</br>=> #MatchData "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"</br>
				Marry Poppins, son!  /[aeiou]/ means a,e,i, or u instead of /aeiou/ which means a followed by e followed by i...</br></br>

				If you are searching for a range of letters(or numbers), you'd use the (-) sign.  For example:</br></br>

				/[0-99a-z]/.match('99problems') #=> #MatchData "9"</br></br>

				If you are trying to exclude seomthing from a search, you can use the caret (^):</br></br>

				/[^a-eg-z]/.match('f') #=> #MatchData "f"</br></br>

				I'm outta time, but there's a whole lot more you can do.  Click <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Regexp.html" target="_blank">here</a> to check it out.</p>
