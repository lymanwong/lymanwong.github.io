				<p id="textarea"><b>When should we use classes?</b></br>
					Well, before answering that question, let's take a step back. Ruby is an Object Oriented Language. That means that Ruby's language uses objects and their associated procedures within the programming context to create software programs.  Object-oriented programming (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qdeH7QhGiRg" target ="_blank">OOP</a>...yeah you know me?) refers to programming style based on objects, insted of just functions and procedures.  The objects are organized into <b>classes</b>, which allow individual objects to be grouped together.  An "object" in OOP refers to a specific type, or "instance", of a class. You can think of a class like a single concept (such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VBkTIb4NtrA" target ="_blank">Thundercats</a>), and an object is a single thing based on a class (such as "Lion-O" or "Cheetara").  If you want to create another concept or object called Thundercats, you can use a class.  While creating the class, which I will show you later, you can add attributes to it (such as name, age, gender, weapon, etc.).</br></br></p>
