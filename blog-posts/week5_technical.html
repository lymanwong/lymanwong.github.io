				<p id="textarea"><b>When should we use classes?</b></br>
					Well, before answering that question, let's take a step back. Ruby is an Object Oriented Language. That means that Ruby's language uses objects and their associated procedures within the programming context to create software programs.  Object-oriented programming (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qdeH7QhGiRg" target ="_blank">OOP</a>...yeah you know me?) refers to programming style based on objects, insted of just functions and procedures.  The objects are organized into <b>classes</b>, which allow individual objects to be grouped together.  An "object" in OOP refers to a specific type, or "instance", of a class. You can think of a class like a single concept (such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VBkTIb4NtrA" target ="_blank">Thundercats</a>), and an object is a single thing based on a class (such as "Lion-O" or "Cheetara").  If you want to create another concept or object called Thundercats, you can use a class.  While creating the class, which I will show you later, you can add attributes to it (such as name, age, gender, weapon, etc.).</br></br></p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>Why should we use classes?</b></br>
					When you are coding, you don't want 100's of different methods and variables that overlap and do the same things or else you'll just go cray cray.  That's where classes come in to keep you organized.  You'll just need to write one method to update your data one place at a time.  It will help you save time and make life easier.  If you've written a method and want to run it on a bunch of different objects; instead of copy the code from a textfile and pasting, just create a class with that method in it and call it on your object. BAM!</br></br>

					Say you want to make an army of 10,000 Stormtroopers. Since your run 'o the mill Stormtrooper looks exactly the same, how about using a class?    I mean, you can store the value of each trooper in a varible, like a Stormtrooper's dexterity, knowledge, mechanical, perception, strength, and technical but that's soooooo repetitive and time consuming when you have to make 10k of them.</br></br>

					Well to make this easier on ourselves, we need to start with a template, in this case, Jango Fett.  We will use this template (or class) to create more Stormtroopers (since they're all exactly the same) with all of the necessary information (or variables) then just clone it and you're ready for war!  Clone Wars. Ha!

				<p id="textarea"><b>How should we use classes?</b></br>
					Creating a class has a particular format; kinda like computers have OCD or something. So let's get back to the Stormtrooper example. Like I mentioned before, we will create a class.  The format looks like this:</br></br>
					
					class Stormtrooper <== the name of the class has to be capitalized</br>
						def initialize(dexterity, knowledge, mechanical, perception, strength, technical) <== We are initializing the object with values you will provide for each characteristic</br>
							@dexterity = dexterity  <== These add variables for the object</br>
    						@knowledge = knowledge</br>
    						@mechanical = mechnical</br>
    						@perception = perception</br>
    						@strength = strength</br>
    						@technical = technical</br>
  						end  <== Here we are ending the definition for initialize</br></br>
  
  						def show_stats  <== I've added this method to print out the stats</br>
    						puts "Dexterity is " + @dexterity.to_s</br>
    						puts "Knowledge is " + @knowledge.to_s</br>
						    puts "Mechanical is " + @mechanical.to_s</br>
						    puts "Perception is " + @perception.to_s</br>
						    puts "Strength is " + @strength.to_s</br>
						    puts "Technical is " + @technical.to_s</br>
						end</br>
					end  <== This final end will close the definition of the class</br></br>
				
					regular_stormtrooper=Stormtrooper.new(5,5,5,5,5,5)  <== We are creating a new regular stormtrooper with the stats</br>
					p regular_stormtrooper.show_stats  <== We are calling (running) show_stats to print the stats out</br></br>
					
					You'll see:</br>
					Dexterity is 5</br>
					Knowledge is 5</br>
					Mechanical is 5</br>
					Perception is 5</br>
					Strength is 5</br>
					Technical is 5</br></br>
					
					When you're ready to create another regular Stormtrooper, you'll just need another unique name.  Notice that the stats are the same:</br></br>

					regular_stormtrooper2=Stormtrooper.new(5,5,5,5,5,5)</br>
					p regular_stormtrooper2.show_stats</br></br>

					You'll see:</br>
					Dexterity is 5</br>
					Knowledge is 5</br>
					Mechanical is 5</br>
					Perception is 5</br>
					Strength is 5</br>
					Technical is 5</br></br>

					If you feel like a saucy master cloner, like <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lama_Su" target="_blank">Lama Su</a>, you can adjust the stats and give them a new name to build a new army:
					imperial_trooper=Stormtrooper.new(2,2,2,2,2,2)</br>
					p imperial_trooper.show_stats</br></br>

					You'll see:</br>
					Dexterity is 2</br>
					Knowledge is 2</br>
					Mechanical is 2</br>
					Perception is 2</br>
					Strength is 2</br>
					Technical is 2</br></br>

					tie_pilot=Stormtrooper.new(2,2,3,3,2,2)</br>
					p tie_pilot.show_stats</br></br>

					You'll see:</br>
					Dexterity is 2</br>
					Knowledge is 2</br>
					Mechanical is 3</br>
					Perception is 3</br>
					Strength is 2</br>
					Technical is 2</br></br>
					
					VIOLA!  That's it.  You've created a simple class and created new objects.</br></br>

					Oh and by the way, check <a href="http://cyberdrone.deviantart.com/art/Paper-Pezzy-Stormtrooper-204855319" target="_blank">THIS</a> out.  You can make your own Stormtrooper!
