				<p id="textarea"><b>What is my thinking and learning style?</b></br>
				I took the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style questionnaire</a> and it indicated that I have 2 thinking styles: <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Concrete Random</a> (40 pts.) and <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Abstract Random</a> (36 pts.) a close second.

				I feel that the Concreate Random "likes" is spot on for me.  During my homework, I go with my instincts and use the trial and error method to figure things out.  Although I do not like to compete with others, I'd rather be the one working on things on my own with little guidance.  I need to keep in mind that there are others that I can leverage experiences from and keep in mind that they're there to help.  I also have problems with quality control because when I complete something, I do not go over them; which I should.  I have to keep the "measure twice and cut once" method in mind if I'm going to bue successful.</br>

				I also took the <a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire"VARK questionnaire</a> and it gave me further insight about my learning preferences.  I found out that I am a multimodal learner: Kinesthetic and Aural with 8 points each. A Kinesthetic learner has the following qualities and preferences:</br></br>
