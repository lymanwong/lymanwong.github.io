				<p id="textarea"><b>What is my thinking and learning style?</b></br>
				I took the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style questionnaire</a> and it indicated that I have 2 thinking styles: <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Concrete Random</a> (40 pts.) and <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Abstract Random</a> (36 pts.) a close second.  A Concrete Random learner has the following properties and preferences:</br></br>

				<p id="textarea"><b>How can I use my thinking and learning style to my advantage at DevBootcamp?</b></br>
				I feel that the Concreate Random "likes" is spot on for me.  During my homework, I go with my instincts and use the trial and error method to figure things out.  Although I do not like to compete with others, I'd rather be the one working on things on my own with little guidance.  I need to keep in mind that there are others that I can leverage experiences from and keep in mind that they're there to help.  I also have problems with quality control because when I complete something, I do not go over them; which I should.  I have to keep the "measure twice and cut once" method in mind if I'm going to bue successful.</br>
				</br>
				I also took the <a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire">VARK questionnaire</a> and it gave me further insight about my learning preferences.  I found out that I am a multimodal learner: Kinesthetic and Aural with 8 points each. A Kinesthetic learner has the following qualities and preferences:</br></br>

				An Aural learner has the following qualites and preferences:</br></br>

				<img src="http://lymanwong.github.io/images/png/aural2.png"></br></br>
				As an Aural learner, I need to not only listen during class, but be able to explain the ideas/concepts to other aural learners in order to solidify my own understanding.  If I don't understand something, I will need to ask the instructor or another student.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea"><b>What What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, what strategies will help me?</b><br>
				The biggest struggle for me is retention.  Before I started the HTML/CSS portion, I studied a lot of JavaScript and Ruby.  Now that we started JavaScript, I'm having a hard time recalling all of the concepts that I've learned.  I believe that I need to keep using the skills I've learned or else I will not remember it.  I've taken notes, but like my learning preferences indicates (Kinesthetic), I need to keep practicing it.</p>

				<p id="textarea"><b>In the context of <a href="http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/index.html">growth vs. fixed mindset</a>, what some ways I can work to expand the ways I learn and think?</b><br>
				I need to remind myself that if I keep at it, I will make it.  Success for me is all about constanly learning and growing, not being too proud to admit that I may not know everything, and have fun!</p>
