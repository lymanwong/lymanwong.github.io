				<p id="textarea">Based on Shereef's Fireside <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank">Chat</a>, my impression of the DBC's experience is that the experience is a sprint. The good thing is that we will nto be going on this journey alone. I really like that Shereef discussed how we are all starting at different experience levels. I do not have a CS degree or even a CS background. I have fear that I will not be able to positively contribute to my group. Well, shit. I have to work through that somehow and know that everyone is here to help. For me, I go to the gym to work that business out in my head.</p>
				
				<p id="textarea">As Sherref's conversation continued, I felt a bit more at ease about how I could let my team down. I also felt more optimistic that I can kill it with a lot of hard work. I look forward to pair with other students and teachers as I know I have a lot to learn.  Above all, I feel a bit nervous/scared and excited about it.  I'm boldly going where I have never gone before!</p>
				
				<p id="textarea">I do have a question: If some students have been accepted multiple months ahead, why can't we start before? I was really excited and I wanted to start right away.</p>

				<p id="textarea">Overall, I really enjoyed the video and I really benefited from it.</p>
